- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SiddharthKhattar! I'm currently studying BCA ( Bachelor Of Computer Applications ) at Maharaja Surajmal Institute which is located in Janakpuri, New Delhi , India.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m in LOVE with everything about videogames, ever since I got my hands on a GBA (GameBoy Advance) I fell in love with gaming. Ever since that moment my passion with gaming never stopped and I later played on PSP,PS2,PS3,PS4 and (hopefully when it comes in stock) a PS5. I've played almost every type of game available and enjoyed many of them. Some of my favourites are HITMAN , Spider-Man PS4, God of War Series, Spider-Man: Web Of Shadows, The Last Of Us , Canis Canem Edit, Far Cry 4 and many others.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development from www.theodinproject.org , I've currently learnt HTML/CSS,PHP and learning JavaScript. Then, after finishing foundations I'll move on either to Front or Back-end Web Development. I also know Python & MYSQL to a certain extent.
